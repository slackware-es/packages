# Slackware packages

This packages repository contains SlackBuild scripts which
use git instead of source package files.

The mechanism to build a package is the same as the [slackbuilds.org](https://slackbuilds.org)
ones.

The idea is to contribute some of these scripts to back to the
[slackbuilds.org](https://slackbuilds.org) project.

This packages has been built only in slackware-current, and might have
dependencies in other repositories provided by the Slackware community.
