# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

jitsi-videobridge: Jitsi Videobridge is an XMPP server component that allows 
jitsi-videobridge: for multiuser video communication. Unlike the expensive 
jitsi-videobridge: dedicated hardware videobridges, Jitsi Videobridge does not 
jitsi-videobridge: mix the video channels into a composite video stream, but 
jitsi-videobridge: only relays the received video channels to all call 
jitsi-videobridge: participants. Therefore, while it does need to run on a 
jitsi-videobridge: server with good network bandwidth, CPU horsepower is not
jitsi-videobridge: that critical for performance.
